<h1>ABOUT <span>FOOTBALL</span></h1>
<h3></h3>
<p>
  Football is a family of team sports that involve, to varying degrees, kicking a ball to score a goal.
   Unqualified, the word football normally means the form of football that is the most popular where the
    word is used. Sports commonly called football include association football (known as soccer in North
     America and Oceania); gridiron football (specifically American football or Canadian football); Australian
     rules football; rugby union and rugby league; and Gaelic football. These various forms of football
     share to varying extent common origins and are known as football codes.
